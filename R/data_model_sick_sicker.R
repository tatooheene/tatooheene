#' Example dataset: data_model_output_sick_sicker
#'
#' A dataset containing model output objects from the **Sick-Sicker** example
#' model developed by the **DARTH (Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health)**
#' workgroup. This dataset includes the results from both annual and monthly
#' Markov model runs, specifically the Markov trace files and related output
#' objects produced during simulation.

#' These data can be used for demonstrating how to apply some of the package functionalities like discounting for the results of a model-based cost-effectiveness model.
#'
#' @format A collection of R objects saved as an `.RData` file containing:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{l_m_M_annual} {List: Markov trace results for the annual-cycle model.}
#'   \item{l_m_M_monthly}{List: Markov trace results for the monthly-cycle model.}
#'   \item{v_wcc_annual} {Vector: half-cycle correction weights for the annual model.}
#'   \item{v_wcc_monthly}{Vector: half-cycle correction weights for the monthly model.}
#'   \item{v_names_str} {Vector: names of the interventions strategies used in the model.}
#'   \item{l_u_annual} {List: annual utilities for each health state.}
#'   \item{l_u_monthly}{List: monthly utilities for each health state.}
#'   \item{l_c_annual} {List: annual costs for each health state.}
#'   \item{l_c_monthly}{List: monthly costs for each health state.}
#' }
#'
#' @details
#' This dataset represents a subset of model outputs intended for demonstrating the discounting in this package.
#' The full model is described in the DARTH “Sick-Sicker” example.
