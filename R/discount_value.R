#' A function to calculate the discounted value of future costs or effects
#'
#'@description
#'`r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#' This function calculates the net discounted value of a future costs or effects based on the constant discounting model as presented in paragraph 2.6.1.2 of the Dutch Costing guideline (version 2024) and the recommended discount rate and time period
#'
#' @param value The value to be discounted.
#' @param discount_rate A categorical indication if the values are costs or health effects. The function uses the numeric discount rates for the Dutch guidelines accordingly (e.g. 0.03 for 3% of costs and 0.015 for 1.% for health effects). Default is 0.03.
#' @param time The time at which the future value occurs.
#' @param discount_year_one Logical value indicating whether to discount the first year as well. Default is FALSE.
#' @return A numeric value of the discounted value.
#' @keywords Discounting, Costs, Effects
#' @examples
#' # Example usage of the discount_value function
#' # Calculate the discounted value of 100 after 3 years, the first year is not discounted
#' discount_value(value = 100, discount_rate = "costs", time = 3)
