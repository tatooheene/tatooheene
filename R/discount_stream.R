#' Calculate the discounted (net present value) of a stream of costs or effects
#'
#' @description
#' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#' This function calculates the net present value of a vector of future costs or effects using constant discounting, as described in the Dutch guideline for economic evaluations in healthcare (section 2.6.1.2 version 2024).
#'
#' @param values        A numeric vector of costs or effects over time (one value per period).
#' @param discount_rate A categorical indication if the values are costs or health effects. The function uses the numeric annual discount rates for the Dutch guidelines accordingly (e.g. 0.03 for 3% of costs and 0.015 for 1.5% for health effects). Default is 0.03.
#' @param discount_year_one Logical: should the first cycle (t = 0) be discounted? Default is FALSE.
#' @param cycle_length_in_years   A numeric argument to indicate of the duration of a cycle length in fraction of a year. For annual cycles, use 1; for monthly 1/12; for weekly 1/52.
#' @param aggregate Logical: should the stream be aggregated? Default is FALSE.

#' @return A numeric vector: the discounted values of the stream (with aggregated = FALSE) or the total discounted sum (when aggregated = TRUE)
#' @examples
#' # Constant cost of 100 for 3 years, no discounting in year 0
#' discount_stream(values = rep(100, 3), discount_rate = "costs", discount_year_one = FALSE)
#'
#' # Constant cost of 100 for 3 years, no discounting in year 0 and give aggregated results
#' discount_stream(values = rep(100, 3), discount_rate = "costs", discount_year_one = FALSE, aggregate = TRUE)
#'
#' # Explore a different discount rate of 4%
#' discount_stream(values = rep(100, 3), discount_rate = 0.04, discount_year_one = FALSE)

#' # Example: Average QALY gain for four years to be discounted
#' discount_stream(values = c(1, 0.98, 0.68, 0.64), discount_rate = "effects", discount_year_one = FALSE)

#' # Monthly QALYs for 1 year
#' discount_stream(rep(1/12, 12), discount_rate = "effects", cycle_length_in_years = 1/12)
